# ðŸš€ One-Click GitHub Pages Setup

## Quick Links:
- **Enable Pages**: https://github.com/ceneer23/cookify/settings/pages
- **Your Future Website**: https://ceneer23.github.io/cookify/

## Settings to Choose:
```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: gh-pages
Folder: / (root)
```

## âœ… After Setup:
Your Cookify webapp will be live at: **https://ceneer23.github.io/cookify/**

The deployment is already ready - I've created the `gh-pages` branch with all the built files. You just need to point GitHub Pages to use it!

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:
If the link doesn't work immediately:
- Wait 5-10 minutes (GitHub Pages takes time to deploy)
- Check that you selected "gh-pages" branch (not "main" or "master")
- Make sure you clicked "Save"

## ðŸ“± Features Your Deployed App Will Have:
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… PWA support (installable)
- âœ… React Router working
- âœ… All components and pages
- âœ… Modern styling with Tailwind CSS

*The app is ready to go - just needs the GitHub Pages switch flipped!* ðŸŽ‰
