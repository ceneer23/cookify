## ⚙️ **Technology Stack**

### 🔧 **Frontend**

* **React.js** – for building dynamic, component-based UI.
* **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first, mobile-first styling.
* **React Router** – for managing routes and pages.
* **Axios** – for HTTP requests to the backend.

* **Express.js** – Fast, minimalist web framework for routing and APIs.
* **Mongoose** – For MongoDB object modeling and schema definition.
* **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** – For secure user authentication.
* **Bcrypt.js** – For password hashing.

### 🛢️ **Database**

* **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud-hosted NoSQL database (highly scalable).

### 🧰 **Other Tools and Integrations**

* **Stripe API** – For payment gateway integration.
